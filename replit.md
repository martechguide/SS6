# Overview

This is a full-stack educational video learning platform built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application provides structured learning through batches and subjects, with video content delivery, progress tracking, and comprehensive monetization features.

The platform features Google OAuth authentication (independent from Replit), hierarchical content management (Batches → Subjects → Videos), and integrated ad monetization systems for revenue generation. The platform is designed to run independently with custom domain support.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)
- **Authentication Independence**: Migrated from Replit OAuth to Google OAuth using passport-google-oauth20
- **Platform Independence**: Platform can now operate independently of Replit infrastructure
- **Custom Domain Support**: Configured for "learnherefree.online" domain deployment
- **Google OAuth Setup**: Complete OAuth integration with Google Cloud Console credentials
- **Admin Dashboard Complete**: Full admin functionality with ads setup, video platforms, monetization restored
- **React Hooks Fixed**: All hooks errors resolved, proper order implemented
- **Ready for VPS Deployment**: Platform prepared for independent server deployment

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the bundler
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Replit OAuth with OpenID Connect using Passport.js
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **API Design**: RESTful API with role-based access control

## Database Design

### Database Schema
- **ORM**: Drizzle with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Core Tables**:
  - Users table for authentication (required for Replit Auth)
  - Sessions table for session storage (required for Replit Auth)
  - Email whitelist table for access control
  - Batches table for organizing learning content
  - Subjects table nested under batches
  - Videos table nested under subjects
  - User progress tracking table
- **Security**: Type-safe queries with prepared statements
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session handling

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Primary Auth**: Google OAuth integration (independent from Replit) with passport-google-oauth20
- **Backup Auth**: Replit OAuth integration (available but not active)
- **Access Control**: Email whitelist system - only approved emails can access content
- **Session Handling**: Server-side sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based authentication checks on all protected routes
- **Admin System**: Role-based access with comprehensive user management panel
- **Independence**: Platform can now run independently with custom domain "learnherefree.online"

## Content Management
- **Video Management - Hierarchical Structure**: Batches → Subjects → Videos
- **Video Integration**: YouTube video embedding with privacy-enhanced URLs and comprehensive protection system
- **Universal Protection System**: Standardized `VideoProtectionSystem` component applied to ALL video embeds automatically
- **Mandatory Implementation**: Every video embed MUST use `VideoProtectionSystem` for consistent blocking functionality
- **Transparent Protection**: All blocking patches are transparent by default with hover visibility (black 80% opacity on hover)
- **Full-Width Coverage**: Top blocker covers entire player width to prevent mobile "Y" visibility
- **Black Video ID Patch**: Bottom center patch remains permanently black to hide video ID numbers
- **Hover Feedback**: Interactive areas become visible on hover to show protection zones
- **Future-Proof Design**: All new video components automatically inherit protection when using the universal system
- **Responsive Design**: Protection patches adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports with percentage-based positioning
- **Progress Tracking**: User watch time and completion status tracking
- **Video Seeking Controls**: Custom forward/backward seeking with interactive timeline
- **Hover Controls**: Video controls appear on hover with play/pause, skip, and volume
- **Timeline Scrubbing**: Interactive seek bar for precise video navigation

## Video Monetization System
